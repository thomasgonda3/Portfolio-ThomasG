    "description":"Hello, my name is Thomas Gonda.  I am a senior at San Diego State studying computer Science, and currently I am gaining experience from building web applications through my time at Learn Academy.  I enjoy working with front-end applications because it gives me an opportunity to utilize coding to create experiences that let me connect with other people.  Iâ€™ve created several games through React, including a full buildout of Chess, Battleship, and Tic-Tac-Toe, and created several web-pages with forms for users to input and receive data.  I want to push these skills further by getting work experience through an internship, and once I feel comfortable in my abilities, I want to try freelancing while I work on some independent projects.
